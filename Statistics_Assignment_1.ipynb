    "As the name suggests, descriptive statistics is one which describes the population. Descriptive Statistics refers to a discipline that quantitatively describes the important characteristics of the dataset. For the purpose of describing properties, it uses measures of central tendency, i.e. mean, median, mode and the measures of dispersion i.e. range, standard deviation, quartile deviation and variance, etc.\n",

    "Inferential : \n",
    "Inferential Statistics is a type of statistics, that focuses on conclusions about the population, on the basis of sample analysis and observation. It includes comparision,tests and observations. It helps to take decision based on observations from sample data taken from population."
